# RCES

This is a repository of various scripts that I've coded in 2019/2020 to help
with [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net) card farming.

Most of them have been created in mid- to late-2019 and have since evolved
significantly. Some of them were previously scattered through Discord and
various gists, notably:

  * [Default Prices](https://gist.github.com/dithpri/d443d2873a4b6212fc0b32894ce15707)
  * [TNP Guild Highlighter](https://gist.github.com/dithpri/7f06ce1bf64d2a4b5ec9225da2f1e3df)
  * [Main Auction Displayer](https://gist.github.com/dithpri/6a3fb524e59755510b18e676039b16d2)
  * [Gardener Highlighter](https://gist.github.com/dithpri/93015dd7281c579ed267dafdf5e97b8d)
  
I'm in the process of consolidating them into this repository to make
management easier and for them to be available to a wider public.

## Bugs

Please report any bugs you encounter by filing an issue. The UserScripts were
tested with TamperMonkey but *should* also work with GreaseMonkey and other
compatible engines.

### What does RCES stand for?

I forgot. I like to invent acronyms and forget what they're all about.
