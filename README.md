# RCES

This is a repository of various scripts that I've coded in 2019/2020 to help
with [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net) card farming.

Most of them have been created in mid- to late-2019 and have been evolved
significantly. All of the scripts in the form checked in with the inital
repository commit are available under the 0BSD license. Everything added or
created in subsequent commits is available under the MIT license. For details,
see [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md).
