# RCES

This is a repository of various scripts that I've coded in 2019/2020 to help
with [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net) card farming.

Most of them have been created in mid- to late-2019 and have since evolved
significantly.

## Bugs

Please report any bugs you encounter by filing an issue. The UserScripts were
tested with TamperMonkey but *should* also work with GreaseMonkey and other
compatible engines.

## Licensing

This project is under the [MIT License](./LICENSE.md). However, some of the
sources have previously been made available under the 0BSD license. All of the
scripts included in the first repository commit are available, in that form,
under the 0BSD license. Everything added or created in subsequent commits is
available under the MIT license. For details, see [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md).

### What does RCES stand for?

I forgot. I like to invent acronyms and forget what they're all about.
